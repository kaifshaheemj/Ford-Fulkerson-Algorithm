# Huffman-Coding

This is a C++ project based on Huffan Algorithm specifically an compression algorithm 

Huffman coding(also known as Huffman Encoding) is an algorithm for doing data compression, and it forms the basic idea behind file compression. 
This post talks about the fixed-length and variable-length encoding, uniquely decodable codes, prefix rules, and Huffman Tree construction

Huffman Coding is a technique of compressing data so as to reduce its size without losing any of the details.
